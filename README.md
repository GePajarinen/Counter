Counter App   
---   
---   

This app is a online React tutorial from [Programming with Mosh - Learn to build fast web apps with React (React js) from scratch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0) </br></br>
It's a simple counter with buttons to increase the value of each item, buttons to delete the item and a Reset button for all the items.    
On the navbar it shows the quantity of items has been increased.   </br></br>
I developed it on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) and it can be runned here:
